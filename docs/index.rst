Welcome to okra's documentation!
================================

How healthy is our software? Okra is a tool that diagnoses the health of
projects which use git version control. Okra uses the 'bus factor' to 
understand project health. 


Applications
------------

Compute the truck/bus factor for an entire git repository. The bus factor is
the smallest sized set of developers which own at least 50% of project files.
Ownership of a file is determined by the author who has contributed the most
lines of code in a file.
